## Hi There! ðŸ‘‹

# Call me D, an emerging Web Developer, UX designer.
# :point_left:Literally :smirk:.

I have a degree in both **Psychology** and **Food Science & Nutrition**, and has had a successful career in food safety management. However, I craved more opportunities to flex my lateral thinking muscles; to be in environments where we can try things, explore new, crazy, or even the worst ideas! Have fun, and also make the magic happen. So, I retrained as a web developer, and is also studying design. 

Check out some of the things I've been working on! If you have any suggestions or feedback, please don't hesitate to get in touch, I thrive in collaborative environments, welcome any feedback that can help me learn, and is always eager to meet new people and listen to your stories :relaxed:
