### Hi There! ðŸ‘‹

Call me D, an emerging Web Developer, UX designer :smirk:.

I have a degree in both **Psychology** and **Food Science & Nutrition**, and has had a successful career in food safety management. However, I was craving a career where I could flex my lateral thinking muscles; be in environments where we can try things, explore new, crazy, or even the worst ideas! Have fun, and also make the magic happen. So, I retrained as a web developer, and is also studying design. 

I'm spending as much time as I can to continue to develop my coding and designing skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, git, Testing (Jasmine), Design Thinking, Adobe Creative Cloud, Miro, Bootstrap...); so that I can build human-centric creative solutions.

Check out some of the things I've been working on! If you have any suggestions, please don't hesitate to get in touch, I thrive in collaborative environments and is always eager to meet new people and listen to your stories :relaxed:
